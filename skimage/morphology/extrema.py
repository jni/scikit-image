"""extrema.py - local minima and maxima

This module provides functions to find local maxima and minima of an image.
Here, local maxima (minima) are defined as connected sets of pixels with equal
grey level which is strictly greater (smaller) than the grey level of all
pixels in direct neighborhood of the connected set. In addition, the module
provides the closely related functions h-maxima and h-minima.

    The local maxima are defined as connected sets of pixels with equal

    neighborhood of the set.

    A local maximum M of height h is a local maximum for which
    there is at least one path joining M with a higher maximum on which the
    minimal value is f(M) - h (i.e. the values along the path are not
    decreasing by more than h with respect to the maximum's value) and no
    path for which the minimal value is greater.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        The input image for which the maxima are to be calculated.
    h : unsigned integer
        The minimal height of all extracted maxima.
    selem : ndarray, optional
        The neighborhood expressed as an n-D array of 1's and 0's.
        Default is the ball of radius 1 according to the maximum norm
        (i.e. a 3x3 square for 2D images, a 3x3x3 cube for 3D images, etc.)

    Returns
    -------
    h_max : ndarray
       The maxima of height >= h. The result image is a binary image, where
       pixels belonging to the selected maxima take value 1, the others
       take value 0.
